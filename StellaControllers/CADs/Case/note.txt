The controller case design was intended to be laser cut from 1/8" acrylic!!!
Make sure to request for that specific thickness at Makerspace.

ALSO: The thickness of the controller itself will differ from each folder. 
	For a 2-inch thick controller, cut the parts in the "2in" folder.
	For a 3-inch thick controller, cut the parts in the "3in" folder.
	
"back face" and "front face" are universal for either controller thickness.
